# SINGLE ELECTRON TRANSISTOR

The SET transistor can be viewed as an electron box that has two separate junctions for the entrance and exit of single electrons (figure 4). It can also be viewed as a field-effect transistor in which the channel is replaced by two tunnel junctions forming a metallic island. The voltage applied to the gate electrode affects the amount of energy needed to change the number of electrons on the island.
